## How To Read A Paper
The seminal tutorial for how to read a paper is S. Keshav's [``How to Read a Paper''](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf). In this work he defines a three pass reading approach, where you balance effort reading and the amount of information you need to obtain from the paper.

Reading a paper shouldn't end at just reading, one must go further and interact with ideas. Below are some documents that propose methods of interacting with the text:
 - [Annotations - Jason Corso](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~jjcorso/t/542W17/files/0-542-syllabus.pdf): Pages 4--5 details techniques for annotating the paper, and summary writeups for application-oriented papers.
