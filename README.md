# Research Life

This is a *draft*, and the information attached is not claiming to be the definite answer to any particular problem. It is mearly meant as a collection of thoughts and ideas, which may inspire other's approach. The focus of these ideas is around graduate school for deep learning and reinforcement learning, but a lot of the information pertains to graduate school and research in general (hopefully).

Each `*.md` document contains their respective information, so explore at your own discretion.

## Draft
Because this is repository is in a super early draft form, I've provided a list of the "started" resources:
 - [`courses.md`](https://github.com/MaxOSmith/research/blob/master/courses.md)
 - [`reading/README.md`](https://github.com/MaxOSmith/research/blob/master/reading/README.md)
 - [`reading/groups`]()
 - [`reading/lists/reinforcement_learning`](https://github.com/MaxOSmith/research/blob/master/reading/lists/reinforcement_learning.md)
 - [`software.md`](https://github.com/MaxOSmith/research/blob/master/software.md)

## Notice

Research is not for *smart* people, it's about working hard, being good with people, and failing.
