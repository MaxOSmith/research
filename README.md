This is a *draft*, and the information attached is not claiming to be the definite answer to any particular problem. It is mearly meant as a collection of thoughts and ideas, which may inspire other's approach. The focus of these ideas is around graduate school for deep learning and reinforcement learning, but a lot of the information pertains to graduate school and research in general (hopefully).

## Notice

Research is not for *smart* people, it's about working hard, being good with people, and failing.
