Various useful computer software.

## Graphics
When creating graphics for reports, you'll want them to be saved as vector graphics. [Vector graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics) are special because what they save is how to reconstruct the image instead of the image itself. This allows it be rerendered at any time in any resolution, so it will always look good. The gold-standard vector editing software is [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html); however, it is not free, but there is a student discount. A popular free alternative is [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/sk/release/0.48.3/).
